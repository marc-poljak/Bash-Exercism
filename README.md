# Bash Learning Track Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from the Bash learning track on Exercism.

## About Exercism

## Getting Started

To get started with the Bash learning track on Exercism, you'll need to:

## Structure

Each exercise in this repository is organized into its own directory. Within each directory, you'll find:

- A `README.md` file containing the exercise description and instructions.
- A `<exercise>.sh` file containing my solution to the exercise.
- Optionally, a `<exercise>.bats` file containing test cases to validate the solution.

Feel free to explore the exercises and solutions at your own pace. Happy coding!
